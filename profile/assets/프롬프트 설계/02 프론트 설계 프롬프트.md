Build a modern, minimalist landing page for a service called "Papercore".
The design should strictly follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines: clean typography, lots of whitespace, subtle shadows, and glassmorphism effects.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (Crucial for animations)
- Lucide React (Icons)

**Core Features & Layout:**

1.  **Hero Section:**
    - Title: "Papercore" (Minimalist font)
    - Subtitle: "AI-curated research papers, delivered daily."
    - Vibe: Professional yet futuristic.

2.  **Interactive "Topic Galaxy" (The Key Feature):**
    - Instead of a simple dropdown or checkbox list, create a visually stunning "Vector Embedding" style visualization area.
    - It should look like a cloud of floating particles/nodes.
    - Each node represents a research topic (e.g., "LLM", "RAG", "Computer Vision", "Reinforcement Learning", "Transformers", "Generative AI").
    - **Visual Style:**
        - Use Framer Motion to make nodes gently float (simulate a breathing or 3D hovering effect).
        - Nodes should be small dots or subtle circles.
        - When a user hovers over a node, it should scale up slightly and reveal the topic name.
        - **Interaction:** When a user CLICKS a node, it becomes "Active".
        - Active state: The node glows (neon blue or apple-blue), connects to neighboring nodes with faint lines, and stays highlighted.
    - This allows users to select multiple interests visually.

3.  **Subscription Form:**
    - A clean input field for "Email Address" below the Topic Galaxy.
    - A "Subscribe" button that looks like an Apple-style pill button (Call to Action).
    - Validation: Ensure email regex check.
    - Loading State: Show a smooth spinner inside the button when submitting.

4.  **Overall Polish:**
    - Use a soft, blurred background gradient (mesh gradient) that moves slowly.
    - Ensure the transition between selecting topics and typing the email feels seamless.
    - Responsive design (Mobile friendly).

**Data Structure for Logic:**
- Maintain a state for `selectedTopics` (Array of strings).
- Maintain a state for `email` (String).
- Mock the submission function to `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` with the JSON payload `{ email, keywords: selectedTopics }`.

Please focus on the "Topic Galaxy" animation quality. It should feel like exploring a data universe.
